## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This Project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about various drugs, their side effects, and the medical conditions. Also,This dataset provieds the review and rating of consumers about their conditions and the medicines that they have used. Thus, this data analysis project aims to provide insights on understanding the various aspects of Drugs based on medical conditions.

## DATA SOURCE

The Primary dataset used for this analysis is "Drugs,Side Effects and Medical condition arrow_drop_up" which is a Microsoft Excel Comma Seperated Value(CVS) File provided by "Unified Mentor" for Internship.

## TOOLS

### EXCEL

- Extracting Data- Power Query Editor (PQE)
- Cleaning & Transforming Data - Removing Duplicate,  Merging and splitting, Transforming and rearranging Columns.
- Data Modelling- Power Pivot
- Data Analysis- Pivot Tables
- Visualizing / Dashboard- Charts, Slicer

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

- Are there differences in Drugs on the basis of Prescription needed, and over the counter or prescription not needed?
- Analysing Drugs on the basis of Interaction with Alcohol?
- Are relation between medical condition and most effective Drugs?
- Are there relation between Drug and Controlled Substances Act(CSA)?
- Are there any effect of Drug on Pregnancy and fetus?
- Are there any relation betwwn Medical Conditions and Drugs available in the data?

## KEY INSIGHTS:


### Findings in Dataset

-  34 Drug names are as " re provided authorization to proceed for Phase 3 trials for its covid 19 Vaccine" Means those drugs are still in clinical trial.
- 1 Drug has no name.
- 124 Drugs with no side effects mentioned, even their brand names were not given.

435 or 15% Drugs are not classified by FDA
502 0r 17% Drugs has no risk on  animals.
1% Drugs has no adequate studies for effect on pregnancy.

## CONCLUSION:

This project involved comprehensive data analysis of Pharmaceutical dataset. This detailed analysis provides valuable insights into the study of drugs with reference to medical conditions. It opens the way for more effective approaches for Pharmaceutical companies as well as for the patients, doctors, and hospitals.
